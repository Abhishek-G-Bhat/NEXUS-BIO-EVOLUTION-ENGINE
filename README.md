# ⚡ NEXUS Evolution Engine

A bio-inspired intelligence simulator that visualizes genetic evolution, neuron computation, and AI reasoning with an interactive neon interface.Its still in initial stage and might do something more to it...in future I might add a backend server,and connect the code to a real ai like openai instead of local ai

 Features

- Genetic Evolution: Simulate populations evolving over generations.  
- DNA Module: Generate and analyze random DNA sequences.  
- Neuron Module: Simulate neuron firing with weighted inputs.  
- Local AI Intelligence: Analyze trends, diversity, and system stability.  
- Interactive UI: futuristic neon panels and glowing outputs.  

How to Use

1. EVOLVE → Run the genetic algorithm and update population stats.  
2. DNA → Generate a DNA sequence and calculate GC content.  
3. NEURON → Simulate neuron firing with random inputs & weights.  
4. AI → Analyze system trends, diversity, and stability.  
5. RESET → Restart the simulation to initial state.  

Open the app, press the buttons, and watch how raw biological-style data transforms into intelligent decisions.
