# NEXUS-EVOLUTION_ENGINE
⚡ NEXUS Bio Evolution Engine

NEXUS is a web-based bio-inspired intelligence simulator integrating genetic algorithms, DNA-protein translation, neuron activation functions, and local AI analysis. It models evolutionary processes with adjustable mutation rates, generates DNA sequences translated into protein codons, simulates neuron activation with Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh functions, and evaluates population dynamics with trend, diversity, and stability metrics.In future I might add a backend server,and connect the code to a real ai like openai instead of local ai.

Features:
Genetic Algorithm with dynamic mutation rate
DNA sequence generation & codon-to-protein translation
Neuron simulation with multiple activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh)
Local AI analyzing trend, diversity, and stability of population
Interactive visual feedback of evolution and neural computations
Adjustable mutation rate slider for controlled evolution experiments

Usage:
Click EVOLVE to run GA iterations
Click DNA to generate DNA and protein sequences
Click NEURON and select Activation to simulate neurons
Adjust Mutation Rate to explore population effects
Click AI to get intelligent insights about evolution progress
Click RESET to restart

Potential Extensions:
Multi-layer neuron networks for deeper computation
Parallelized GA using Web Workers
Full codon table with protein functional annotations
Real-time visualization of fitness landscape
Contributions are welcomed
